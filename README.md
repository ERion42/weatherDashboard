# Hello Weather!

Hello, Weather! is a streamlined weather dashboard. It gives the current weather, as well as a 5 day forecast of the chosen city.

## Installation

This code just utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So long as the file structure remains intact it should run without problems.


## Usage

Simply input the city you want to search for in the "search cities" input and click "search". The interface will load the city, showing the current forecast as well as the forecast for the next five days. 

It utilizes local storage so it will store up to 8 cities you've searched for. To recall a city you searched for recently, just click the button and the interface does the rest.


## Contributing

Same as usual- Any input it appreciated. Needlessly hurtful criticism will just be ignored (to the best of my ability.)


## Current iteration

0.1  The html, css, and Javascript seem to be functioning properly. This is the bare minimum I'd consider for the first iteration. 


## Future Development Plans

- Add a "Clear history" button

- Work on styling for buttons with no city attached

- Add weather icons
